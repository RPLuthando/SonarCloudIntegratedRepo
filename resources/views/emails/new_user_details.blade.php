<h2>Welcome PayUneers</h2>

<p>PayU Global has engaged with Rapid Assurance to manage and provide the Minimum Security Standards (MSS) assessments. From now on you, as the relevant specialist, will be assigned surveys online which will need to be completed by the designated dates. These surveys are significant and the metrics count towards PayU governance requirements and reporting obligations. </p> 

<p>For reference and as a starting point, the information that was provided to us in the last round of updates has been imported into the system. Please check the responses over carefully and make any changes that are required. </p> 

<p>Each measured “Security Domain” has now been implemented as a separate survey and each will be scored for compliance and as a percentage.  Scores are visible throughout the process and changes are now recorded. </p> 

<p>You can access the assessments assigned to you at <a clicktracking=off href="https://payu.rapidassurance.ai">payu.rapidassurance.ai</a></p>

<p>You will be sent a OTP to your registered email address.</p>  

<p>Please reach out to our team on this email address <a href="mailto:info@rapidassurance.ai">(info@rapidassurance.ai)</a> if you experience any problems or have suggestions for where we can improve.</p> 

<p>Regards</br/>
Rapid Assurance</p>
